This is my Highlights folder! The code in here spans a few years, and displays the projects that I worked the hardest on and am most proud of.

These are the best displays of my coding talent as they show what I am capable of when I really apply myself, and they show the projects I was the most passionate over. This is the kind of code I love to write, and hope to keep writing one day for a job!
