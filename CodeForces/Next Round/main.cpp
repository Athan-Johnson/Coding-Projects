/*
 * Input
 * The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1≤k≤n≤50) separated by a single space.
 *
 * The second line contains n space-separated integers a1,a2,...,an (0≤ai≤100), where ai is the
 * score earned by the participant who got the i-th place. The given sequence is non-increasing
 * (that is, for all i from 1 to n-1 the following condition is fulfilled: ai≥ai+1).
 *
 * Output
 * Output the number of participants who advance to the next round.
