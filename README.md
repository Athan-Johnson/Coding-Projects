# Coding-Projects
Hello and welcome!

This is my public repo of all my coding projects that I like to move around between my two computers, as well as keep track of various coding projects I have done. 

If you got here by clicking my resume, I would suggest going into my Highlights! foler, as those projects are my personal favorites, and I think do the best job of showing just how far I have come as a coder.
